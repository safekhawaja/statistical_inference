# STAT431: Statistical Inference:

### Studies 

Experimental studies run by ***comparison***. There are two divisions: a test group and a control group. Ideally, the two groups are as similar as possible, as other confounding variables can be the cause of differences in results.
We can use large numbers with randomization to improve similarity. Controls should be given placebo and researchers and subjects should have a double-blind screen as to who is in which group.

Observational studies cannot assign treatment and control groups. Therefore, we can find correlated associations but not conclude because of confounding variables in between.
Ideally, we observe smaller groups controlled for particular factors as well to observe variations for said confounding variables. 

Sampling: selection of a subset of individuals from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole population.
